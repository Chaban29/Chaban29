Iâ€™m a Front-End developer with experience in creating engaging, interactive user interfaces. I am proficient in 
React, TypeScript, and JavaScript, which allows me to build robust and scalable applications. Aside from the 
essentials, I ensure clean, maintainable code throughout all projects. I have expertise in HTML5 and CSS3, and I 
utilize Sass to style efficiently while adhering to the BEM methodology for a structured and organized codebase.
I am always ready to study the latest technologies and introduce them into my projects. I feel comfortable in the 
field of programming, particularly in web development.
